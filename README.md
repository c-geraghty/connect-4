# connect-4
A basic implementation of the simple game of Connect 4, completed in Java as part of a University coursework.

The objective was to fault-find, and then extend an existing program to allow for play against a "computer" player, 
allowing for games to be played with only 1 human player. This was to be done whilst making appropriate use of OOP principles throughout.
